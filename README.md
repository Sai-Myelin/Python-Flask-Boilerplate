# Intro
This project is a beginner template intended to showcase the basics of Flask's routing and rendering system.
Take note of the render_template file structure.
Use this project as a building block for more complex web apps.

Currently, this just renders a page (templates/index.html) which has the ability to call a function in the app.py from Javascript.

It is a cool basic example and serves a useful purpose. Please email me if you have questions: blade@aelo.io

**Python 3+ is required. Flask is the only required library.**

## ðŸ”Œ *Example Usage*:
To run this, clone the repo onto your local machine.

- Navigate to the repo in terminal or CMD.
- Run app.py by calling `python3 app.py` or `python app.py` depending on your Python installation.


## Expected Output:
If Flask & Python are working as expected, you should see this output:

## Next Steps:
This project is a good starter example for anyone to become familar with the basics of Flask's routes and render_template system.
A database can be added for creating user accounts.
Passwords can be hashed in Python functions.
More complex and robust routing strategies can be implemented.
